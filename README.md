A free project file that contains the whole pipeline to making a blob tracking video with unlimited blobs, given that the free version of TouchDesigner limits users to only two. The full effects suite is seeking to reproduce this video done in the payed version of TouchDesigner: https://youtu.be/ioSVh06MySc?si=vVBTbCcJNt8U44xp

All you need to do: put in your video of choice, edit the line/wireframe to preferred colour + thickness, change the multiplication factor and position of the trace grid when changing the resolution from 16:9 for which this plug-in is based on.
